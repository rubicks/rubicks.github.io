    <p>You know that feeling you get when you find a new (tool|library|framework|machine) and start thinking, &ldquo;OMG. This is exactly what I need to solve this problem I&rsquo;ve been having.&ldquo;? That&rsquo;s the way I felt about hugo when I first read about it. My old static site generator was hakyll. Hakyll is a very nice and very capable static site generator modelled on jekyll and implemented in haskell. My problem with hakyll is one of availability&mdash;my CI service of choice (Travis) doesn&rsquo;t have hakyll installed on their default images.</p>

    <p>Maven. Uberjar. If those two words made you cringe just now, then you know my pain. The googles runneth over with purported fixes and outright lies. One guy seems to have it figured out. Teaser: use the maven shade plugin. Leiningen ships with the uberjar target baked in. Just saying.</p>

    <p>Something broke my laptop&rsquo;s NetworkManager. At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was happening. The usual reboot trick didn&rsquo;t work. Resetting the network also didn&rsquo;t work. Once I resigned myself to actually reading the error messages (and googling them on my phone), it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to trace the problem back to DNS. Specifically, I had no DNS. This is what my /etc/resolv.conf looked like: # Generated by NetworkManager This is what it used to look like (/etc/resolv.conf.tmp): # Generated by NetworkManager nameserver 10.0.0.1 Residential network troubleshooters will recognize that particular nameserver as the one running on the overworked little router sitting between you and your ISP.</p>

    <p>I learned about pipefail today. From the bash(1) man page: pipefail If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non- zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully. This option is disabled by default. Basically, it works like this: $ set -o | grep pipefail pipefail off $ false | tee `mktemp` $ echo $?</p>

    <p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing out of the way right now: Windows sucks. The reasons are myriad, but I&rsquo;m not going to get into them. We all know it sucks, just as we all know that Windows users are legion. Most of the time, I don&rsquo;t have to think about that family of operating systems. That&rsquo;s because, over the course of 16 years, I learned and used various Linux distros. It was never magical and sometimes painful, but on average, those distros worked as advertised.</p>

    <p>Remember when I was all excited about barry? Remember how I was going to turn all those PNG images into byte-arrays and compile them directly into the rendera executable? What ever happened with that? The short story is that it didn&rsquo;t work out that way. The reasons for this include (but are not limited to) the following: recursive automake is really hard to get right recursive autoconf is even harder to get right This is not to say that such things are impossible.</p>

    <p>Did you know that autotest is a thing? No, not that autotest, this autotest. I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t&mdash;not until about a week ago. I have no idea what to make of it. On the plus side: it has no external dependencies it comes &ldquo;for free&rdquo; with autoconf it isn&rsquo;t horribly complicated On the minus side: it&rsquo;s still kind of complicated it forces you to write unit tests in m4. not many people use it the documentation is pretty thin It&rsquo;s not at all like writing unit tests with automake.</p>

    <p>You don&rsquo;t know me, Chris Packham, but I owe you a debt of gratitude. Let me explain&hellip; I use autotools. The autotools are The Means by which one configures (and builds and distributes) software. Sure, they&rsquo;re weird, but they work. I also use git. Git is The Means by which one versions (and branches and releases) software. I don&rsquo;t have to apologize for anything with git&mdash;it&rsquo;s universally awesome and everything else sucks hard.</p>

    <p>I made this for you! https://github.com/rubicks/barry By &ldquo;this&rdquo;, I mean a silly little program, and by &ldquo;you&rdquo;, I mean computer nerds with too much time on their hands. This is firmly within the scratch-your-own-itch category of software. Here&rsquo;s how it started&hellip; Mortis69 has been developing rendera for a very long time. Rendera is a gui application for image manipulation. I saw rendera on the sourceforge &ldquo;Help Wanted&rdquo; forums, and in a fit of hubris, I decide I could make a contribution.</p>

    <p>Back in the day, emacs users could M-x gdb and the correct thing would happen. Notably, when the thing being debugged spit to stdout, emacs didn&rsquo;t spawn some weird *input/output* buffer. Even better, it didn&rsquo;t replace your source code listing buffer with the *input/output* buffer it just spawned. These days it&rsquo;s more complicated. You have to M-x gud-gdb if you want the old behavior; i.e., everything happens right on the gdb prompt and (most importantly) the source code listing never abruptly disappears.</p>

    <p>I had a problem with the sound coming from the flash browser plugin: it wasn&rsquo;t. Somewhere between youtube and my laptop speakers, the audio was getting dropped. Luckily, another Arch user has already trouble-shot this problem. Here are the steps I followed: $ pacman -S lib32-alsa-plugins lib32-libcanberra-pulse $ pkill chromium $ nohup chromium &amp; I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s fixed&mdash;the silence was really starting to bother me.</p>

    <p>Getting hakyll, travis-ci, and github-pages to work together isn&rsquo;t difficult, but not trivial, either. When using hakyll, the working process is simple enough: $ emacs -nw ./stuff.md # hack on templates and markdown files $ ghc --make site.hs # create ./site executable $ ./site build # create site artifacts in ./_site/ Github likes jekyll&mdash;so much so that jekyll enjoys native support on github-pages. Insofar as I&rsquo;m aware, jekyll is the only static site generator that github-pages supports.</p>

    <p>Here&rsquo;s a recipe for faster, bassier listening: $ sox -V -S Alex\ Clare\ -\ Too\ Close.ogg -d --norm tempo 1.2 bass +10 Explanation: sox is the best at what it does -V bumps verbosity from 2 (default) to 3 -S displays progress while processing -d directs output to the default audio device --norm auto-adjusts the pregain (down) to prevent clipping tempo 1.2 makes it 20% faster bass +10 does exactly what you think it does Pretty sweet.</p>

    <p>I can&rsquo;t clain I&rsquo;ve been running the Ubuntu distro since the dim dark ages, but I have used every release since 6.06 &ldquo;Dapper Drake&rdquo;. Successive upgrades have taught me two things: backup before the upgrade fix the X configuration files after the upgrade The first is just good sense. The last is probably a symptom of my slightly uncommon setup. Indeed, I run the ratpoison window manager and nearly all of my daily workflow happens in xterm and emacs.</p>

    <p>It astounds me that I have been ignorant of sdiff until today. The last merging tool I remember using was something called meld. It ran in a KDE-flavored gui that seemed nice, but it was overkill for what I needed; i.e., I didn&rsquo;t know how (or if) it would run in bash. I like emacs M-x ediff as much as the next code monkey, but sometimes you want a little tool for a little job.</p>

    <p>Q. Which printers does cups know about and what&rsquo;s their stati? A. lpstat knows: $ lpstat -v device for HP-Color-LaserJet-CP3525: socket://MA-PRINT6-1.pc.fracsec.com:9100 $ lpstat -a HP-Color-LaserJet-CP3525 accepting requests since Wed 12 Mar 2014 03:09:15 PM EDT Note that I&rsquo;m not nearly l33t enough to setup or configure printers on the command line. No, I had to use $ system-config-printer and step through the GUI. Someday, I&rsquo;ll figure out how to do it with nothing but bash and cups utilities.</p>

    <p>The 37 Signals-affiliated authors of Getting Real (namely Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Matt Linderman) would have me Feel the Pain by exposing myself to end users and the interruptions they bring. I&rsquo;m sure they would also prefer I, in the course of feeling that pain, Answer Quick since &ldquo;quick turnaround time on support queries should be a top priority&rdquo;. You might remember Jason Fried&rsquo;s piece on The Big Think, wherein he explains that interruptions and productivity are mutually opposed.</p>

    <p>GitHub Pages with Jekyll seems like a pretty neat way to host a blog. I&rsquo;m not new to GitHub. I&rsquo;ve spent literally years working with it and cringe whenever I have to use anything else. It&rsquo;s gotten to the point where I can&rsquo;t take other source control platforms seriously. Does that make me a SCM-bigot? I hope not. Jekyll, on the other hand, is very new to me. I don&rsquo;t know much about the concept of a static site generator, but I do know Holman&rsquo;s Left made it dead simple to get this site up and running.</p>
