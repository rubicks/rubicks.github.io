  <p>Remember when I was <a href="2014-12-14-barry.html">all excited</a> about <a href="https://github.com/rubicks/barry"><code>barry</code></a>?
Remember how I was going to turn all those PNG images into byte-arrays and
compile them directly into the <code>rendera</code> executable? What ever happened with
that?</p>

<p>The short story is that it didn&rsquo;t work out that way. The reasons for this
include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Subdirectories">recursive automake</a> is <em>really hard</em> to get right</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Subdirectories">recursive autoconf</a> is <em>even harder</em> to get right</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that such things are impossible. Recall that I managed get
automake subdirectories working when I
<a href="2015-01-04-autotest.html">started using autotest</a>. That little job, however,
was mostly copypasta&mdash;I had some (not many) examples from which to steal.</p>

<p>Building the <code>barry</code> executable as a subproject of <a href="https://github.com/Mortis69/rendera"><code>rendera</code></a> to then
use the former to generate source code for the latter&mdash;that is what I set out
to do.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a single example implementation&mdash;not <em>one</em>. After many
faltering attempts, I discovered that such a thing it is actually
possible. Unfortunately, for someone with my meager <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">m4</a> skills, the effort
required is completely unjustified.</p>

<p>So, I did something else.</p>

<p>It started as a directory path problem; i.e., the directory hierarchy of build
(automake&rsquo;s <code>$(builddir)</code>) didn&rsquo;t match that of the installation (autoconf&rsquo;s
<code>$(prefix)</code>). So, if they don&rsquo;t match, we&rsquo;ll just make symlinks until do. How,
exactly? Why, in <code>configure.ac</code>, of course:</p>

<pre><code>...

AC_PROG_LN_S
AC_PROG_MKDIR_P

...

(
  $MKDIR_P share/rendera &amp;&amp; \
  cd share/rendera       &amp;&amp; \
  $LN_S ../../&quot;${srcdir}&quot;/data
)
</code></pre>

<p>I should probably change that relative path to its absolute equivalent, but, for
the moment, it&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>Update: I deleted the <strong>submod_barry</strong> branch on my rendera repo, but I did
manage to get a <strong>submod_fltk</strong> branch working.</p>

<p>Update: I deleted the <strong>submod_fltk</strong> branch on my rendera repo. The git
submodule stuff was working. The cross compilation of FLTK was not.</p>
