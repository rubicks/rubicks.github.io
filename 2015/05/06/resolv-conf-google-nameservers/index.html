  <p>Something broke my laptop&rsquo;s <code>NetworkManager</code>. At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was
happening. The usual reboot trick didn&rsquo;t work. Resetting the network also didn&rsquo;t
work. Once I resigned myself to actually reading the error messages (and
googling them on my phone), it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to trace the problem back to
DNS. Specifically, I had no DNS. This is what my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> looked like:</p>

<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
</code></pre>

<p>This is what it <em>used to</em> look like (<code>/etc/resolv.conf.tmp</code>):</p>

<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 10.0.0.1
</code></pre>

<p>Residential network troubleshooters will recognize that particular nameserver as
the one running on the overworked little router sitting between you and your
ISP. I don&rsquo;t know why (or how) <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager"><code>NetworkManager</code></a> did that to
my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> but I <em>do</em> know that I didn&rsquo;t care to find out. My first
priority was to restore DNS.</p>

<p>Did you know google runs nameservers that just <em>anyone</em> can use? I did. After I
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration">read about it</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I made my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> look like this:</p>

<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
</code></pre>

<p>which fixed literally everything that was wrong with my DNS. Thanks, google.</p>

<p>Then, I followed a link to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dnsmasq">a page about <code>dnsmasq</code></a>, which
got me really excited about setting up my own <code>dnsmasq</code> local service. Then, I
realized that I have more pressing things to do with my time&mdash;like writing
about my little successes in my blog.</p>
