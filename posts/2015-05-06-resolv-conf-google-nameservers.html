<p>Something broke my laptop’s <code>NetworkManager</code>. At first I wasn’t sure what was happening. The usual reboot trick didn’t work. Resetting the network also didn’t work. Once I resigned myself to actually reading the error messages (and googling them on my phone), it wasn’t difficult to trace the problem back to DNS. Specifically, I had no DNS. This is what my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> looked like:</p>
<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager</code></pre>
<p>This is what it <em>used to</em> look like (<code>/etc/resolv.conf.tmp</code>):</p>
<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 10.0.0.1</code></pre>
<p>Residential network troubleshooters will recognize that particular nameserver as the one running on the overworked little router sitting between you and your ISP. I don’t know why (or how) <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager"><code>NetworkManager</code></a> did that to my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> but I <em>do</em> know that I didn’t care to find out. My first priority was to restore DNS.</p>
<p>Did you know google runs nameservers that just anyone use? I did. After I <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration">read about it</a>.</p>
<p>Then, I made my <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> look like this:</p>
<pre><code># Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4</code></pre>
<p>which fixed literally everything that was wrong with my DNS. Thanks, google.</p>
<p>Then, I followed a link to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dnsmasq">a page about <code>dnsmasq</code></a>, which got me really excited about setting up my own <code>dnsmasq</code> local service. Then, I realized that I have more pressing things to do with my time—like writing about my little successes in my blog.</p>
