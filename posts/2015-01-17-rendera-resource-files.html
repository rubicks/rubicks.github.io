<p>Remember when I was <a href="2014-12-14-barry.html">all excited</a> about <a href="https://github.com/rubicks/barry"><code>barry</code></a>? Remember how I was going to turn all those PNG images into byte-arrays and compile them directly into the <code>rendera</code> executable? What ever happened with that?</p>
<p>The short story is that it didn’t work out that way. The reasons for this include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Subdirectories">recursive automake</a> is <em>really hard</em> to get right</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Subdirectories">recursive autoconf</a> is <em>even harder</em> to get right</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not to say that such things are impossible. Recall that I managed get automake subdirectories working when I <a href="2015-01-04-autotest.html">started using autotest</a>. That little job, however, was mostly copypasta—I had some (not many) examples from which to steal.</p>
<p>Building the <code>barry</code> executable as a subproject of <a href="https://github.com/Mortis69/rendera"><code>rendera</code></a> to then use the former to generate source code for the latter—that is what I set out to do.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find a single example implementation—not <em>one</em>. After many faltering attempts, I discovered that such a thing it is actually possible. Unfortunately, for someone with my meager <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">m4</a> skills, the effort required is completely unjustified.</p>
<p>So, I did something else.</p>
<p>It started as a directory path problem; i.e., the directory hierarchy of build (automake’s <code>$(builddir)</code>) didn’t match that of the installation (autoconf’s <code>$(prefix)</code>). So, if they don’t match, we’ll just make symlinks until do. How, exactly? Why, in <code>configure.ac</code>, of course:</p>
<pre><code>...

AC_PROG_LN_S
AC_PROG_MKDIR_P

...

(
  $MKDIR_P share/rendera &amp;&amp; \
  cd share/rendera       &amp;&amp; \
  $LN_S ../../&quot;${srcdir}&quot;/data
)</code></pre>
<p>I should probably change that relative path to its absolute equivalent, but, for the moment, it’s working.</p>
<p>Update: I deleted the <strong>submod_barry</strong> branch on my rendera repo, but I did manage to get a <strong>submod_fltk</strong> branch working.</p>
<p>Update: I deleted the <strong>submod_fltk</strong> branch on my rendera repo. The git submodule stuff was working. The cross compilation of FLTK was not.</p>
