<p>The <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>-affiliated authors of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php"><em>Getting</em> <em>Real</em></a> (namely <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/writers/jf">Jason Fried</a>, <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, and <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/writers/mattlinderman">Matt Linderman</a>) would have me <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch14_Feel_The_Pain.php">Feel the Pain</a> by exposing myself to end users and the interruptions they bring. I’m sure they would also prefer I, in the course of feeling that pain, <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch14_Answer_Quick.php">Answer Quick</a> since “quick turnaround time on support queries should be a top priority”.</p>
<p>You might remember <a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/why-you-cant-work-at-work">Jason Fried’s piece on The Big Think</a>, wherein he explains that interruptions and productivity are mutually opposed. Fried dislikes many things about the modern workplace, not the least of which are meetings. Meetings tax intellectual workers the greatest because intellectual work is inherently high-latency while meetings demand low-latency interaction.</p>
<p>Does anyone besides me see the contradiction? Do I understand correctly that <em>Getting Real</em> and <em>Why You Can’t Work at Work</em> each give very different advice regarding interruptions? Assuming the contradiction exists, how should I resolve these conflicting strategies?</p>
