<p>I can’t clain I’ve been running the Ubuntu distro since the dim dark ages, but I have used every release since 6.06 “Dapper Drake”. Successive upgrades have taught me two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>backup before the upgrade</li>
<li>fix the X configuration files after the upgrade</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is just good sense. The last is probably a symptom of my slightly uncommon setup. Indeed, I run the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison">ratpoison</a> window manager and nearly all of my daily workflow happens in xterm and emacs. I’ve run this way for the past four years or so.</p>
<p>In that time, every Ubuntu upgrade has consistently broken something about my setup. Nearly always, it’s my right Alt (Meta, whatever) key behavior. <code>xev</code> says my right alt key is <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code>. This makes for a nice surprise in emacs when right-alt-x does NOT give me the <code>M-x</code> I need. The most recent fix involved <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap">xmodmap</a> and its <code>~/.Xmodmap</code>:</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %} clear Mod1 keycode 108 = Alt_R NoSymbol Alt_R add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Since I already had</p>
<p>{% highlight bash %} exec xmodmap .Xmodmap {% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>in my <code>~/.ratpoisonrc</code>, I thought I was good. I wasn’t. Somehow, the execution of xmodmap was failing silently on login. I was just about to give up hope when I found <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/361128/why-did-13-10-break-my-custom-keyboard-layout">a similarly afflicted user</a>. Apparently, X is recompiling and reusing keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, control-(left|right) was broken in xterm; it wasn’t skipping words like it should. Copying <code>/etc/inputrc</code> to <code>~/.inputrc</code> fixed it, but I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Not cool, Ubuntu. One of these days I’ll have to jump ship to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>.</p>
