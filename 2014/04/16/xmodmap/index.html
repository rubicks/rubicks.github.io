  <p>I can&rsquo;t clain I&rsquo;ve been running the Ubuntu distro since the dim dark ages, but I
have used every release since 6.06 &ldquo;Dapper Drake&rdquo;. Successive upgrades have
taught me two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>backup before the upgrade</li>
<li>fix the X configuration files after the upgrade</li>
</ul>

<p>The first is just good sense. The last is probably a symptom of my slightly
uncommon setup. Indeed, I run the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison">ratpoison</a> window manager and
nearly all of my daily workflow happens in xterm and emacs. I&rsquo;ve run this way
for the past four years or so.</p>

<p>In that time, every Ubuntu upgrade has consistently broken something about my
setup. Nearly always, it&rsquo;s my right Alt (Meta, whatever) key behavior. <code>xev</code>
says my right alt key is <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code>. This makes for a nice surprise in
emacs when right-alt-x does NOT give me the <code>M-x</code> I need. The most recent fix
involved <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xmodmap">xmodmap</a> and its <code>~/.Xmodmap</code>:</p>


clear Mod1
keycode 108 = Alt_R NoSymbol Alt_R
add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R


<p>Since I already had</p>


exec xmodmap .Xmodmap


<p>in my <code>~/.ratpoisonrc</code>, I thought I was good. I wasn&rsquo;t. Somehow, the execution
of xmodmap was failing silently on login. I was just about to give up hope when
I found <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/361128/why-did-13-10-break-my-custom-keyboard-layout">a similarly afflicted user</a>. Apparently, X is recompiling and
reusing keyboard layouts.</p>

<p>As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, control-(left|right) was broken in xterm; it wasn&rsquo;t
skipping words like it should. Copying <code>/etc/inputrc</code> to <code>~/.inputrc</code> fixed it,
but I have no idea why.</p>

<p>Not cool, Ubuntu. One of these days I&rsquo;ll have to jump ship to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>.</p>
