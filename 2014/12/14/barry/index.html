  <p>I made this for you!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rubicks/barry">https://github.com/rubicks/barry</a></p>

<p>By &ldquo;this&rdquo;, I mean a silly little program, and by &ldquo;you&rdquo;, I mean computer nerds
with too much time on their hands. This is firmly within the
scratch-your-own-itch category of software. Here&rsquo;s how it started&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Mortis69">Mortis69</a> has been developing <a href="https://github.com/Mortis69/rendera">rendera</a> for a very long
time. Rendera is a gui application for image manipulation. I saw rendera on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/helpwanted/">sourceforge &ldquo;Help Wanted&rdquo; forums</a>, and in a fit of
hubris, I decide I could make a contribution. I&rsquo;ve never done anything with gui
applications, but my arrogance more than makes up for my ignorance.</p>

<p>Like most gui applications, rendera has various little images that need to be
placed on the window. The images need to exist somewhere, so rendera (quite
reasonably) keeps them as PNG files in a certain directory. When the program
starts, various initializers open the files, read them into memory, and paint
them on the screen. It works like gangbusters as long as the files are where the
program expects them to be.</p>

<p>Mortis69 likes to build in-source, so the built binary (again, reasonably)
assumes a certain path to the needed PNGs <em>relative to rendera project root
directory</em>. Which is fine. It&rsquo;s better than fine&mdash;it works.</p>

<p>I like to build out-of-source, so that doesn&rsquo;t work for me. I had a problem. At
the time, I didn&rsquo;t even know what kind of problem it was. &ldquo;What do you call the
files that you need to distribute that aren&rsquo;t source code, test scripts, or
autotoolery.&rdquo; As I found out, you call them &ldquo;resource files&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Resource files are
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9242524/data-files-with-gnus-autoconf-and-automake">tricky</a>. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Directory-Variables">GNU convention</a> dictates you
install architecture-independent data files into either of the</p>

<pre><code>${PREFIX}/share
${PREFIX}/share/${PROJECT_NAME}
</code></pre>

<p>paths; i.e., the automake-defined <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Data">data directory variables</a>
<code>$(datadir)</code> and <code>$(pkgdatadir)</code>, respectively. That works
great&mdash;<em>after</em> you install your thing. The situation is more complicated
<em>before</em> installation, like, for instance, when you run the freshly-built
binary.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way to rig autoconf and automake such that you know, at
compile-time, where your resources live. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll figure that out
eventually. I probably should have worked on that, but instead I wrote a tool
that turns files into source code.</p>

<p>Why would I do that? I don&rsquo;t know, really. The whole resource-file thing was
just pissing me off and my impatience got the better of me. Turning binary data
files into byte arrays is cute trick, and it definitely simplifies any
interactions with resources, but it doesn&rsquo;t scale very well. Or at all.</p>

<p>I should probably go back to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html">automake manual</a>.</p>
