title: Interruptions

The [37 Signals][37signals]-affiliated authors of
[_Getting_ _Real_][gettingreal] (namely [Jason Fried][jf],
[David Heinemeier Hansson][dhh], and [Matt Linderman][ml]) would have me
[Feel the Pain][feelthepain] by exposing myself to end users and the
interruptions they bring. I'm sure they would also prefer I, in the course of
feeling that pain, [Answer Quick][answerquick] since "quick turnaround time on
support queries should be a top priority".

You might remember [Jason Fried's piece on The Big Think][cantwork], wherein he
explains that interruptions and productivity are mutually opposed. Fried
dislikes many things about the modern workplace, not the least of which are
meetings. Meetings tax intellectual workers the greatest because intellectual
work is inherently high-latency while meetings demand low-latency interaction.

Does anyone besides me see the contradiction? Do I understand correctly that
_Getting Real_ and _Why You Can't Work at Work_ each give very different advice
regarding interruptions? Assuming the contradiction exists, how should I resolve
these conflicting strategies?
