I can't clain I've been running the Ubuntu distro since the dim dark ages, but I
have used every release since 6.06 "Dapper Drake". Successive upgrades have
taught me two things:

 * backup before the upgrade
 * fix the X configuration files after the upgrade

The first is just good sense. The last is probably a symptom of my slightly
uncommon setup. Indeed, I run the [ratpoison][ratpoison] window manager and
nearly all of my daily workflow happens in xterm and emacs. I've run this way
for the past four years or so.

In that time, every Ubuntu upgrade has consistently broken something about my
setup. Nearly always, it's my right Alt (Meta, whatever) key behavior. `xev`
says my right alt key is `ISO_Level3_Shift`. This makes for a nice surprise in
emacs when right-alt-x does NOT give me the `M-x` I need. The most recent fix
involved [xmodmap][arch-xmodmap] and its `~/.Xmodmap`:

{{< highlight bash >}}
clear Mod1
keycode 108 = Alt_R NoSymbol Alt_R
add Mod1 = Alt_L Alt_R
{{< / highlight >}}

Since I already had

{{< highlight bash >}}
exec xmodmap .Xmodmap
{{< / highlight >}}

in my `~/.ratpoisonrc`, I thought I was good. I wasn't. Somehow, the execution
of xmodmap was failing silently on login. I was just about to give up hope when
I found [a similarly afflicted user][broke-kb]. Apparently, X is recompiling and
reusing keyboard layouts.

As if that wasn't enough, control-(left|right) was broken in xterm; it wasn't
skipping words like it should. Copying `/etc/inputrc` to `~/.inputrc` fixed it,
but I have no idea why.

Not cool, Ubuntu. One of these days I'll have to jump ship to [Arch][arch].
