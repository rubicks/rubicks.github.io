Getting [hakyll][hakyll], [travis-ci][travis-ci], and
[github-pages][github-pages] to work together isn't difficult, but not trivial,
either.

When using hakyll, the working process is simple enough:

```
$ emacs -nw ./stuff.md    # hack on templates and markdown files
$ ghc --make site.hs      # create ./site executable
$ ./site build            # create site artifacts in ./_site/
```

Github likes [jekyll][jekyll]---so much so that jekyll enjoys native support on
github-pages. Insofar as I'm aware, jekyll is the only static site generator
that github-pages supports. Users of other static site generators (e.g., hakyll
and [pelican][pelican]) must do things the hard way. For hakyll users, this
means getting the contents of ```./_site/``` into your github-pages repo.

Let's automate it.

One pelican user, Kevin Yap, managed to do
[something similar][yap-deploys-pelican] with his
site. [His deploy script][yap-deploy-sh] borrows from
[earlier work][zonca-pelican] by Andrea Zonca, another pelican user. I adapted
Yap's deploy script to make [my own][my-deploy-sh].
