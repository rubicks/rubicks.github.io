Back in the day, emacs users could

    M-x gdb

and the correct thing would happen. Notably, when the thing being debugged spit
to stdout, emacs didn't spawn some weird ```*input/output*``` buffer. Even
better, it didn't replace your source code listing buffer with the
```*input/output*``` buffer it just spawned. These days it's more
complicated. You have to

    M-x gud-gdb

if you want the old behavior; i.e., everything happens right on the gdb prompt
and (most importantly) the source code listing never abruptly disappears.

Thanks, [stackoverflow][so-gud]!
