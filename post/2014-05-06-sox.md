Here's a recipe for faster, bassier listening:

```
$ sox -V -S Alex\ Clare\ -\ Too\ Close.ogg -d --norm tempo 1.2 bass +10
```

Explanation:

 * `sox` is the best at what it does
 * `-V` bumps verbosity from 2 (default) to 3
 * `-S` displays progress while processing
 * `-d` directs output to the default audio device
 * `--norm` auto-adjusts the pregain (down) to prevent clipping
 * `tempo 1.2` makes it 20% faster
 * `bass +10` does exactly what you think it does

Pretty sweet.
