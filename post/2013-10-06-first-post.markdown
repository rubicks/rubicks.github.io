[GitHub Pages][gp] with [Jekyll][jekyll] seems like a pretty neat way to host a
blog.

I'm not new to GitHub. I've spent literally years working with it and cringe
whenever I have to use anything else. It's gotten to the point where I can't
take other source control platforms seriously. Does that make me a SCM-bigot? I
hope not.

Jekyll, on the other hand, is very new to me. I don't know much about the
concept of a static site generator, but I do know [Holman][holman]'s
[Left][left] made it dead simple to get this site up and running. I'll probably
never be a jekyll maven, but this is good enough for now.

Update: [I dropped Jekyll in favor of Hakyll](2014-11-22-hakyll.html).
