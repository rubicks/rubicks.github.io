title: Merging with sdiff
url: /2014/04/09/sdiff/
---

It astounds me that I have been ignorant of [`sdiff`][man-sdiff] until
today. The last merging tool I remember using was something called
[`meld`][meldmerge]. It ran in a KDE-flavored gui that seemed nice, but it was
overkill for what I needed; i.e., I didn't know how (or if) it would run in
bash.

I like emacs `M-x ediff` as much as the next code monkey, but sometimes you want
a little tool for a little job.

    $ sdiff -o outfile.txt file1.txt file2.txt
    # ... interactive merging session ...
    $ mail -s "merged stuff" boss@bigcorp.com < outfile.txt

I wish I had known about this utility earlier. Apparently, Linux Magazine had a
nice [article][linux-mag-sdiff] about it a while ago. The gnu
[documentation][gnu-sdiff] is pretty extensive.
