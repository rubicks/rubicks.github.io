  <p>You know that feeling you get when you find a new
(tool|library|framework|machine) and start thinking, &ldquo;OMG. This is exactly what
I need to solve this problem I&rsquo;ve been having.&ldquo;? That&rsquo;s the way I felt about
<a href="hugo"><code>hugo</code></a> when I first read about it.</p>

<p>My old static site generator was <a href="hakyll">hakyll</a>. Hakyll is a very nice and
very capable static site generator modelled on <a href="jekyll">jekyll</a> and implemented
in <a href="haskell"><code>haskell</code></a>. My problem with hakyll is one of availability&mdash;my
CI service of choice (<a href="travis">Travis</a>) doesn&rsquo;t have hakyll installed on their
default images.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no stranger to bending remote virtual machines to my will. I can do
the debug-from-a-distance dance as well as anyone. Many months ago, when I was
fresh and new to hakyll, I spent hours reading error logs spat by distant
Travis machines, pawing through dependencies, and <a href="cabal"><code>cabal</code></a>
<code>install</code>ing package after package. It worked, eventually. I won my battle
against the <code>cabal</code> and the pipeline&mdash;such as it was&mdash;actually worked. It
was slow as hell (because of <code>cabal</code>, or <code>haskell</code>, or the JVM, or
something) but it worked nonetheless.</p>

<p>Then something changed. Maybe Travis upgraded the image. Maybe the <code>cabal</code>
grew restless. Maybe <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">cosmic rays</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know and
didn&rsquo;t care. I <em>absolutely did</em> know that didn&rsquo;t have it in me to fight the
<code>cabal</code> anew. I went looking for something else, something easier but not
necessarily better.</p>

<p>Hugo is what I found. Hugo wins in all of the ways hakyll failed me. Hugo is
implemented in <a href="go"><code>go</code></a>, which makes it (without much hyperbole)
available <em>everywhere</em> and faster than <em>anything</em>. Even over my feeble DSL ISP,
I can install hugo and its dependencies in 2 minutes. Even on my underpowered
laptop, I can build my entire site in 63 ms. Sixty-three milliseconds!!! Behold
the power of Go.</p>

<p>The content authorship workflow is nearly identical to that of Jekyll and
Hakyll. The markup &ldquo;front matter&rdquo; is easy on the brain. Installing and using
themes is dead simple.</p>

<p>tldr; Hugo wins. Consider it if you&rsquo;re looking for a static site generator.</p>
