I learned about `pipefail` today. From the `bash(1)` man page:

    pipefail
        If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value
        of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-
        zero  status,  or zero if all commands in the pipeline
        exit successfully.  This option is disabled by default.

Basically, it works like this:

    $ set -o | grep pipefail
    pipefail off
    $ false | tee `mktemp`
    $ echo $?
    0
    $ false | tee `mktemp`
    $ echo $PIPESTATUS
    1
    $ set -o pipefail
    $ set -o | grep pipefail
    pipefail on
    $ false | tee `mktemp`
    $ echo $?
    1
    $

Enabling the `pipefail` option forces the *entire pipeline* to return failure if
*any constituent command* returns failure. Otherwise, only the return status of
the last (rightmost) command is reported---which may well be success despite
some earlier command reporting failure.
