Did you know that __autotest__ is a thing? No, not
[*that* autotest](https://github.com/autotest/autotest),
[*this* autotest][autoconf-autotest]. I sure as hell didn't---not until about a
week ago. I have no idea what to make of it. On the plus side:

* it has no external dependencies
* it comes "for free" with [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
* it isn't horribly complicated

On the minus side:

* it's still kind of complicated
* it forces you to write unit tests in [m4][m4].
* not many people use it
* the documentation is pretty thin

It's not at all like writing [unit tests with automake][automake-tests]. Since
autotest is a facility of autoconf, it initializes before automake does. Getting
it to initialize properly depends heavily on setting up some
[weird boilerplate][autotest-boilerplate]. You have to

* give autotest its own directory (```tests``` by convention) within your
  project
* populate ```tests``` with
    * ```Makefile.am``` defining certain targets
    * ```testsuite.at``` implementing your unit tests
* within ```configure.ac```
    * invoke ```AC_CONFIG_TESTDIR``` on ```tests```
    * invoke ```AC_CONFIG_FILES``` on ```tests/Makefile```
* within ```Makefile.am```, add ```tests``` to your ```SUBDIRS``` variable

I consider myself to have barely-better-than-average competence with the
autotools, but getting this set up was moderately difficult for me. The time
investment was a little more than a week, and I can't say for sure if it was
worth it. My m4 skills are almost non-existent---I don't know if I can maintain
a sane testing methodology with an unfamiliar language. Whatever; I did it, I
learned something, and maybe I've got something worth keeping.
